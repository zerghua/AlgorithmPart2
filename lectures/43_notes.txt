Minimum Spanning tree(MST)
----------------------------------------------------------
Given undirected graph G with positive edge weights(connected).
A Spanning tree of G is a subgraph T that is both a tree(connected
and acyclic) and spanning(includes all of the vertices).

Goal. Find a min weight of a spanning tree.
Brute force. Try all spanning trees?


Example.
Network design(Bike route).
Models of nature.
Medical image processing.



Greedy Algorithm
----------------------------------------------------------
Simplifying assumptions.
- Edge weights are distinct.
- Graph is connected.

Consequence. MST exists and is unique


Cut property.
Def. A cut in a graph is partition of its vertices into
two(nonempty) sets.

Def. A crossing edge connects a vertex in one set with a
vertex in the other.

Cut property. Given any cut, the crossing edge of min weight
is in the MST.


Greedy MST algorithm
- Start with all edges colored gray.
- Find cut with no black crossing edges; color its min-weight
edge black.
- Repeat until V-1 edges are colored black.

Efficient implementations. Choose cut? Find min-weight edge?
1. Kruskal's algorithm.
2. Prim's algorithm.
3. Boruvka's algorithm.


Removing two simplifying assumptions.
Q. What if edge weights are not all distinct?
A. Greedy MST algorithm still correct if weights are present.
multiple MST path.

Q. What if graph is not connected?
A. Compute minimum spanning forest = MST of each component.


Weighted edge API
----------------------------------------------------------
Edge abstraction needed for weighted edges.

public class Edge implements Comparable<Edge>
    Edge(int v, int w, double weight)
int either()
int other(int v)
int compareTo(Edge that)
double weight()
String toString()

Idiom for processing an edge e:
int v = e.either(), w = e.other(v);


Edge-weighted graph API

public class EdgeWeightedGraph
    EdgeWeightedGraph(int v)
void AddEdge(Edge e)
Iterable<Edge> adj(int v)

Conventions. Allow self-loops and parallel edges.


Adjacency-lists representation
Maintain vertex-indexed array of Edge lists.


// add edge to both adjacency lists
public void addEdge(Edge e){
    int v = e.either(), w = e.other(v);
    adj[v].add(e);
    adj[w].add(e);
}


MST API
public class MST
    MST(EdgedWeightedGraph G)
Iterable<Edge> edge()
double weight()     // total weight of MST
