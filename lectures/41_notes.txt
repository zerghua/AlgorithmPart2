Some graph-processing problems

1. Path. Is there a path between s and t?
2. Shortest path. What is the shortest path between s and t?

3. Cycle. Is there a cycle in the graph?
4. Euler tour. Is there a cycle that uses each edge exactly once?
5. Hamilton tour. Is there a cycle that used each vertex exactly once?

6. Connectivity. Is there a way to connect all of the vertices?
7. MST(Minimum Spanning Tree). What is the best way to connect all of the vertices?
8. Bioconnectivity. Is there a vertex whose removal disconnects the graph?


9. Planarity. Can you draw the graph in the plane with no crossing edges?
10.Graph isomorphism. Do two adjacency list represent the same graph?
