Directed Graph

----------------------------------------------------------
Introduction

Digraph. Set of vertices connected pairwise by directed edges.

indegree: edges coming in
outdegree: edges going out

examples

Bank loan
Circuit board
WordNet


Digraph problems
1. Is there a directed path from s to t?
2. Shortest path from s to t?
3. Topological sort. Can you draw a digraph so that all edges point upwards?
4. Strong connectivity. Is there a directed path between all pairs of vertices?
5. Transitive closure. For which vertices v and w is there a path from v to w?
6. PageRank. What is the importance of a web page?

Digraph API


public class Digraph{
    Digraph(int v)
    Digraph(In in)
    void addEdge(int v, int w)
    Iterable<Integer> adj(int v)
    int V()
    int E()
    Digraph reverse()
    String toString()
}


Adjacency-lists digraph representation
Maintain vertex-indexed array of lists.

public class DiGraph{
    private final int V;
    private Bag<Integer>[] adj; // arraylist of arraylist

    public DiGraph(int V){
        this.V = V;
        adj = (Bag<Integer>[]) new Bag[V];
        for(int v =0; v < V; v++) adj[v] = new Bag<Integer>();
    }

    public void addEdge(int v, int w){
        adj[v].add(w);   // only one direction for digraph
    }

    public Iterable<Integer> adj(int v){
        return adj[v];
    }
}

Digraph Search
Reachability
Find all vertices reachable from s along a directed path.

Solution
the same method as undirected graphs. DFS.

To visit a vertex v:
1. Mark vertex v as visited
2. Recursively visit all unmarked vertices pointing from v.


Reachability application
1. Program control-flow analysis
2. mark-sweep garbage collector(Java)
Vertex=object
Edge=reference

mark-sweep algorithm
-Mark: mark all reachable objects
-Sweep: if object is unmarked, it is garbage(so add to free list)


BFS
the same as undirected graphs.
BFS computes shortest path.

Multiple-source shortest paths
Given a digraph and a set of source vertices, find shortest
path from any vertex in the set to each other vertex.

BFS in digraph applications
web crawler(why not DFS? self-loops of traps?)




----------------------------------------------------------
Topological Sort
Precedence scheduling
Goal. Given a set of tasks to be completed with precedence
constrains, in which order should we schedule the tasks?

Digraph model
Vertex=task
Edge=precedence constraint


DAG. Directed acyclic graph. (No cycle)
Topological sort. Redraw DAG so all edges point upwards.

Solution. DFS.
- Run DFS
- Return vertices in reverse postorder.

public class DepthFirstOrder{
    private boolean[] marked;
    private Stack<Integer> reversePost;

    public DepthFirstOrder(Graph G){
        reversePost = new Stack<Integer>();
        for(int v = 0; v < G.V(); v++){
            if(!marked[v]) dfs(G, v);
        }
    }

    private void dfs(Graph G, int v){
        marked[v] = true;
        for(int w : G.adj(v)){
            if(!marked[w]){
                dfs(G, w);
            }
        }
        reversePost.push(v);
    }

    public Iterable<Integer> reversePost(){
        return reversePost;
    }
}


Proposition.
1. Reverse DFS postorder of a DAG is a topological order.
2. A digraph has a topological order iff no directed cycle.


Directed cycle detection applications
1. Java compiler does cyclic detection
2. Excel does cyclic detection



----------------------------------------------------------
Strong Components
Strongly-connected components
Def. Vertices v and w are strongly connected if there is a
directed path from v to w and a directed path from w to v.

Key property.
Strong connectivity is an equivalence relation.
1. v is strongly connect to v.
2. if v is strongly connected w, then w is to v.
3. if v is strongly connected w, and w to x, then v is to x.

Def. A strong component
is a maximal subset of strongly-connected vertices.

connected components vs strongly-connected components

connected components:
v and w are connected if there is a path between them.

Strongly connected:
v and w are connected if there is a path from v to w and w to v.

share the same solution.


Strong components applications.
1. ecological food webs.
2. software modules(dependency).


Strong components algorithms
1980s: Kosaraju-Sharir
easy two-pass linear-time algorithm

Reverse graph. Strong components in G are the same in G(R).

Kernel DAG. Contract each strong component into a single vertex.


Idea.
1. Compute topological order(reverse postorder) in kernel DAG.
2. Run DFS, considering vertices in reverse topological order.

similar to connect components.
